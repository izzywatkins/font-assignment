<h1>Where The Sidewalk Ends</h1>
<h2>by Shel Silverstein</h2>

<p>There is a place where the <span class=highlight>sidewalk</span> ends 
and before the street begins, 
and there the grass grows soft and <span class=bigger>white,</span>
and there the sun burns crimson <span class=bigger>bright,</span>
and there the moon-bird rests from his <span class=bigger>flight</span>
to cool in the peppermint wind. </p>

<p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black 
and the dark street winds and bends. 
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers <span class=bigger>grow</span>
we shall walk with a walk that is measured and <span class=bigger>slow</span>
and watch where the chalk-white arrows <span class=bigger>go</span>
to the place where the <span class=highlight>sidewalk</span> ends. </p>

<p>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and <span class=bigger>slow,</span> 
and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows <span class=bigger>go,</span> 
for the children, they mark, and the children, they <span class=bigger>know,</span> 
the place where the <span class=highlight>sidewalk</span> ends.</p>
